# AskQuery Application - Scripts Guide

This project includes several scripts to help you run and manage the application:

## Scripts

### `run_app.sh`
- Runs the application in the foreground with real-time logging to both console and log file
- Creates timestamped log files in the `logs/` directory
- Best for development and debugging

### `start_app.sh`
- Starts the application in the background
- Creates timestamped log files in the `logs/` directory
- Provides the PID for easy management
- Best for production or daemon-like usage

### `stop_app.sh`
- Automatically generated by `start_app.sh`
- Stops the background application using the PID
- Safely terminates the Java process

### `view_logs.sh`
- Views the latest log file in real-time using `tail -f`
- Useful for monitoring the application

## Usage

### To run in foreground (recommended for development):
```bash
./run_app.sh
```

### To start in background:
```bash
./start_app.sh
```

### To view logs in real-time:
```bash
./view_logs.sh
```

### To stop the background application:
```bash
./stop_app.sh
```

## Log Files

All log files are stored in the `logs/` directory with timestamps in their names:
- `app_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - for foreground runs
- `app_background_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - for background runs

## Prerequisites

Make sure to build the project before running the scripts:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

The application JAR file is located at `build/libs/qwen-project-0.1.0.jar`.

## Environment Variables

Before running the application, make sure to set the required environment variable:
```bash
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or you can pass the API key as a system property:
```bash
java -Ddashscope.api.key=your_api_key -cp build/libs/qwen-project-0.1.0.jar com.example.askquery.Main
```
